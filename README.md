# Svelte Component Gateway

Grabs a compiled Svelte component (ES Module) from the interwebs and mounts it so it to the DOM, so you can check it out, use it, and run your data (props) through it.

## Usage

Save a Svelte component to the internet (maybe using something like [Web3 Repl Deploy](https://douganderson444.github.io/web3-repl-deploy/)) then paste the URL for the resulting es module / Svelte Component into this gateway.

This gateway will render the component and add the props so you can chekc it out.

## TODO

- [ ] Lots to do:
- [ ] Pass in props in a variable way
- [ ] Pass in props according to Component props schema?
- [ ] Sandbox the iframe for untrusted code execution
- [ ] Fetch improvements
