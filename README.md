# Svelte Component Gateway

Grabs a compiled Svelte component (ES Module) from the interwebs and mounts it so it to the DOM, so you can check it out, use it, and run your data (props) through it.

## TODO

- [ ] Lots to do:
- [ ] Pass in props in a variable way
- [ ] Pass in props according to Component props schema?
- [ ] Sandbox the iframe for untrusted code execution
- [ ] Fetch improvements
